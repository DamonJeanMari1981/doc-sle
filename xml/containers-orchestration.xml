  <title>Pod Deployment with Podman</title>

  <para>
   In addition to building and managing images, &podman; makes it possible to
   work with pods. A pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared
   storage and network resources. A pod usually encapsulates an application
   composed of multiple containers into a single unit.
  </para>

  <para>
   The <command>podman pod</command> can be used to create, delete, query, and
   inspect pods. To create a new pod, run the <command>podman pod create --name
   <replaceable>PODNAME</replaceable></command> command. This creates a pod
   with a random name. To list the existing pods, use the <command>podman pod
   list</command> command. To view a list of running pods, run <command>podman
   ps -a --pod</command>. Notice that the created pod has an
   <literal>infra</literal> container identified by the
   <filename>k8s.gcr.io</filename> name. The purpose of this container is to
   keep the namespaces associated with the pod and allow &podman; to add other
   containers to the pod.
  </para>

  <para>
   Using the <command>podman run --pod</command> command, you can run a
   container and add it to the desired pod. For example, the command below runs
   a container based on the <literal>suse/sle15</literal> image and add the
   container to the <filename>example</filename> pod:
  </para>

<screen>podman run -dt --pod example registry.suse.com/suse/sle15 bash</screen>

  <para>
   Containers in a pod can be restarted, stopped, and started without affecting
   the overall status of the pod. For example, you can stop the container
   <literal>example</literal> using the <command>sudo podman stop
   example</command> command.
  </para>

  <para>
   To stop the pod, use the <command>podman pod stop</command> command:
  </para>

<screen>podman pod stop <replaceable>POD_NAME</replaceable></screen>
